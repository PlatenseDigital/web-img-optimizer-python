# Web Image Optimizer by Platense Digital
This is a really easy converter of any image file to WEBP. It is a version in another language of: https://github.com/PlatenseDigital/web-img-optimizer

## functionalities
- Drag and drop or Click and search for file upload
- automatically transforms the images to webp and save them zipped.

### Future updates
- Detect when you upload only one file and download it without put it in a zip folder.
- Word-less interface (replacing all texts with images and icons for better accessibility)
- advanced mode button with:
  - Resize options.
  - Quality options

## Download and use
You can download the folder inside build that corresponds to your system and use it directly. If it is not found, you can try to compile it. You already have a preconfigured setup.py for cx_Freeze

##Why a python version?
Because I don't like electron too much and I want to improve the application because I use it very frequently. python turned out to be simple and effective, with the possibility of exporting it to different devices.
